# What We learned from this module.

This tool is helpful with regards to analysing the date without having to use the code all the time and makes writing the same code redundent.
irstly, I have taken the time series www usage data and then checked if it had any null values, this can be done by a single click or by dragging and dropping the data in the work space

I have used data processing techniques like joining data, modifying data and validation rules.

While joining data we can check for none values by checking the nan box without writing the code, this helps removing the null values out.

Depending on the use case and our need we can later join the whole data or just the values that we need for our analysis. 

Functions like binomial, multi-nominal and distribution that are there in this tool which come under one sample distribution data, it is easy to use in this tool.

Any and all the constarints that might come up are mentioned in the description and a precise report for the same is generated with exact speicfic functionalities that are used in the anylisis of the date set.
